📦 Supply Chain Analysis Using Python

This project focuses on analyzing a supply chain dataset to derive actionable business insights using Python. It covers multiple areas including revenue analysis by location, transportation mode optimization, demand forecasting, and inventory management.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes detailed records of product types, sales, stock levels, logistics, manufacturing costs, inspection outcomes, and transportation information. It has 24 columns and captures key dimensions of supply chain operations.

Key Features:
Product type, SKU, Price

Number of products sold, Revenue generated

Availability, Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities

Manufacturing lead time, Manufacturing costs, Defect rates, Inspection results

Transportation modes, Routes, Costs

Customer demographics, Location

🧠 Key Analysis Areas
1. 📍 Revenue by Location
Identified Mumbai and Kolkata as top contributors to total revenue.

Suggested bundling strategies and targeted marketing for other locations.

2. 🚚 Transportation Mode Strategy
Analyzed cost-effectiveness, average shipping times, and revenue impact of each mode.

Found rail generated the highest revenue, while sea was the most cost-efficient.

3. 🔮 Demand Forecasting
Used RandomForestRegressor to predict the Number of products sold.

Features selected: price, stock levels, lead times, production volumes, and manufacturing costs.

4. 📦 Inventory Optimization
Calculated stock turnover rate to identify fast-moving product categories.

Skincare showed the highest turnover, requiring more frequent restocking.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
pandas, numpy – Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

sklearn – Machine learning (modeling, training, and evaluation)

📊 Insights Generated
Road transport is the most cost-effective.

Rail generates the most revenue.

Skincare has the highest sales and stock turnover rate.

Forecasting sales helps in inventory planning and minimizing stockouts.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrate time-series analysis if timestamp data becomes available.

Add supplier performance metrics.

Explore clustering for customer segmentation.
